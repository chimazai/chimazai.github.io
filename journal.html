		<h2>Entry 1: 10-4-2021</h2>
		<p>In CS1, I learned how to create an HTML document using SublimeText, and put it online using our terminal. We have also learned how to use the style tag in an HTML doc. I feel like I’ll be able to make my website easily with this. I’m working on putting pictures of stuff I like on the homepage, then putting an introduction division in the middle. Those are my goals.</p>

<h2>Entry 2: 11-3-2021</h2>

<p>Today, I have learned how to call on and name functions. Functions are commands that allow you to store chunks of code in Javascript, and then call on that code to use it in your program. Right now, I'm making a function that counts to 100 and above. I want it to be displayed in the middle of the screen, and I will add buttons so it can be stopped and started again whenever.</p>

<h2>Entry 3: 2-9-2022</h2>

<p> I haven't been keeping track of my journal, so I'll bring it up to speed. I have now made a kind of "color keyboard". I made it so three divs are changed with one function by adding an event listener for keypressing, and then put a keycode so a key can only change one div that it's already connected to. I made it so every time a key is pressed, it puts three variables in the rgb() command, all randomized from 0-255. Therefore, every time a key is pressed, a div changes color, so you can type words and have colors, or just spam the keyboard. Cool, right? </p>
